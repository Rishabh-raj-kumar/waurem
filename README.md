## Waurem: Waste Reduction with AI and User Engagement

*Description:*

Waurem empowers individuals and communities to tackle waste management through a combination of AI technology and user participation. It leverages computer vision and natural language processing to offer these features:

- *Real-time Waste Detection:* Identify various waste objects accurately using a camera stream.
- *Interactive AI Chatbot:* Engage with the system through a chatbot that answers waste-related questions and provides educational content on recycling, composting, and responsible waste practices.
- *Blog and Point System:* Contribute to the project by writing informative blogs about waste reduction. Earn points for your contributions, which can be used for future benefits (details to be announced).
- *User Accounts and Community (Future):* Build a secure user authentication system to track points, access exclusive features, and interact with other users in a chatroom or community forum (planned for future implementation).

*Getting Started:*

1. *Prerequisites:*
    - Python 3.x ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
    - Necessary libraries (specified in requirements.txt)
    - A camera ([Optional] If deploying for real-time detection)
2. *Installation:*
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/waurem.git
    cd waurem
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
3. *Usage:*
    - *Model Training:* (If applicable, depending on your chosen object detection model)
        Instructions specific to your chosen model will be provided here. Consider including links to the model's documentation.
    - *Running the Application:*
        bash
        python main.py
        
        This command will typically launch the user interface. Refer to any additional configuration options documented within the code.

*Deployment:*

- *Considerations:*
