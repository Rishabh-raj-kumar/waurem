## Waurem: Waste Reduction with AI and User Engagement

*Description:*

Waurem empowers individuals and communities to tackle waste management through a combination of AI technology and user participation. It leverages computer vision and natural language processing to offer these features:

- *Real-time Waste Detection:* Identify various waste objects accurately using a camera stream.
- *Interactive AI Chatbot:* Engage with the system through a chatbot that answers waste-related questions and provides educational content on recycling, composting, and responsible waste practices.
- *Blog and Point System:* Contribute to the project by writing informative blogs about waste reduction. Earn points for your contributions, which can be used for future benefits (details to be announced).
- *User Accounts and Community (Future):* Build a secure user authentication system to track points, access exclusive features, and interact with other users in a chatroom or community forum (planned for future implementation).
